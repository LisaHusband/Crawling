I could put on the back of a postcard
The song that I can sing
But I can try for your heart
Our dreams, they're made out of real things
Like a shoebox of photographs
Of sepia tone loving
Love is the answer
At least, for most of the questions in my heart
Like, ""Why are we here?"" and, ""Where do we go?""
And, ""How come it's so hard?""
It's not always easy and sometimes life can be deceiving
I'll tell you one thing
It's always better when we're together
Mmm, it's always better when we're together
Yeah, we'll look at the stars when we're together
Well, it's always better when we're together
Yeah, it's always better when we're together
And all of these moments just may find their way
Into my dreams tonight
But I know that they'll be gone
When the morning light sings and brings new things
For tomorrow night, you'll see
That they'll be gone soon
So many things I have to do
But if all of these dreams might find a way
Into my day to day scene
I'll be under the impression
I was somewhere in-between
With only two, just me and you
Now, so many things we got to do
Or places we've got to be
We'll sleep beneath the mango tree now
Yeah, it's always better when we're together
Mmm, somewhere in-between together
Well, it's always better when we're together
Yeah, it's always better when we're together
I believe in memories
They look so, so pretty when I sleep
When I wake up, you look so pretty
Sleeping next to me
But there is not enough time
There is no, no song I could sing
And there is no combination of words I could say
But I will still tell you one thing
We're better together

Walks through the garden rows
With her bare feet laughin'
I never learned to count my blessings
I choose instead to dwell in my disasters
I walk on down the hill
Through grass grown tall and brown and still
It's hard somehow to let go of my pain
On past the busted back of that old and rusted Cadillac
That sinks into this field collecting rain
Will I always feel this way?
So empty, so estranged?
Of these cut-throat busted sunsets
These cold and damp white mornings I have grown weary
If through my cracked and dusty dime store lips
I spoke these words out loud
Would no one hear me?
Lay your blouse across the chair
Let fall the flowers from your hair
And kiss me with that country mouth so plain
Outside the rain is tapping on the leaves
To me, it sounds like they're applauding us
The quiet love we've made
Will I always feel this way?
So empty, so estranged?
Well, I looked my demons in the eyes
Lay bare my chest, said, ""Do your best to destroy me""
See, I've been to hell and back so many times
I must admit you kinda bore me
There's a lot of things that can kill a man
There's a lot of ways to die
Yes, and some already did and walk beside me
There's a lot of things I don't understand
But so many people lie
It's the hurt I hide that fuels the fire inside me
Will I always feel this way?
So empty, so estranged?

Here we are just the same,
Don't need pressure, don't need change,
Let's not give the game away
There used to be an empty space,
A photograph without a face,
But with your presence and your grace,
Everything falls into place
Just please don't say you love me,
Cause I might not say it back,
Doesn't mean my heart stops skipping
When you look at me like that
There's no need to worry when
You see just where we're at
Just please don't say you love me
Cause I might not say it back
Heavy words are hard to take,
Under pressure precious things can break,
And how we feel is hard to fake,
So let's not give the game away
Just please don't say you love me,
Cause I might not say it back,
Doesn't mean my heart stops skipping
When you look at me like that
There's no need to worry when
You see just where we're at
Just please don't say you love me
Cause I might not say it back
Fools rush in
And I've been fooled before,
This time I'm gonna slow it down,
Cause I think this could be more,
The thing I'm looking for
Just please don't say you love me,
Cause I might not say it back,
Doesn't mean my heart stops skipping
When you look at me like that
There's no need to worry when
You see just where we're at.
Just please don't say you love me
Cause I might not say it back
Please don't say you love me,

You can turn a phrase into a weapon or a drug
You can be the outcast
Or be the backlash of somebody's lack of love
Or you can start speaking up
Nothing's gonna hurt you the way that words do
When they settle 'neath your skin
Kept on the inside and no sunlight
Sometimes a shadow wins
But I wonder what would happen if you
Say what you wanna say
And let the words fall out
Honestly I wanna see you be brave
With what you want to say
And let the words fall out
Honestly I wanna see you be brave

I just wanna see you

I just wanna see you
I wanna see you be brave
Everybody's been there, everybody's been stared down
By the enemy
Fallen for the fear and done some disappearing
Bow down to the mighty
But don't run, stop holding your tongue
Maybe there's a way out of the cage where you live
Maybe one of these days you can let the light in
Show me how big your brave is
Say what you wanna say
And let the words fall out
Honestly I wanna see you be brave
With what you want to say
And let the words fall out
Honestly I wanna see you be brave
Innocence, your history of silence
Won't do you any good
Did you think it would?
Let your words be anything but empty
Why don't you tell them the truth?
Say what you wanna say
And let the words fall out
Honestly I wanna see you be brave
With what you want to say
And let the words fall out
Honestly I wanna see you be brave
I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
I wanna see you be brave

Singing like they found the Lord

Got on a lucky one, came in eighteen to one
I've got a feeling this year's for me and you
So happy Christmas, I love you baby
I can see a better time when all our dreams come true
They've got cars big as bars, they've got rivers of gold
But the wind goes right through you It's no place for the old
When you first took my hand on a cold Christmas Eve
You promised me Broadway was waiting for me
You were handsome
You were pretty, Queen of New York City
When the band finished playing they howled out for more
Sinatra was swinging, all the drunks they were singing
We kissed on the corner then danced through the night
The boys of the NYPD choir were singing 'Galway Bay'
And the bells were ringing out for Christmas day
You're a bum, You're a punk
You're an old slut on junk
Lying there almost dead on a drip in that bed
You scum bag, You maggot, You cheap lousy faggot
Happy Christmas your arse, I pray God It's our last
The boys of the NYPD choir were singing 'Galway Bay'
And the bells were ringing out for Christmas day
I could have been someone
Well so could anyone
You took my dreams from me when I first found you
I kept them with me babe, I put them with my own
Can't make it all alone I've built my dreams around you

泣きそうな目で見つめる君を
雲のような優しさでそっとぎゅっと

吐き出せるほど強くはない

かみしめて歩く 今日という日に 何と
名前をつけようかなんて話して
ああ アイラブユーの言葉じゃ
足りないからとキスして

Watch it fall from the sky
Feel it soak through my flesh and my blood
Feel it burn in my eyes
When I say how much more can I take?
I know the water's rising up, watch the waves crest and break
And though I've made nothing but a sound
I fear that I may drown
I fear that I may drown
Here comes the wind again
Cold that cuts to the bone
Pack my bags and I'll head out the door
Here I am on my own
When I say how much more can I stand?
I know my walls are falling down
I left the rocks and chose the sand
And though I've no one left to blame
Still, I cursed your name
I cursed your name
So now the end
What I've been running from
Though I've tried I cannot lift my head
Oh, what have I become?
When I say how much more can I take?
I know my time is running short, I am broken and I'll break
And though I've worn myself so thin
I'm coming home again
And though I do not know my heart
Well, I know myself down to my bones, but if my bones should come apart
Then I'll have nothing left to give
But if you take me in
I'm coming home again
And if you take me in
I'm coming home again

Been workin' at the convenience store
Managed to save just a little bit of money
We won't have to drive too far
Just 'cross the border and into the city
You and I can both get jobs
Finally see what it means to be living
You see my old man's got a problem
Live with the bottle, that's the way it is
He says his body's too old for working
His body's too young to look like his
My mama went off and left him
She wanted more from life than he could give
I said somebody's got to take care of him
So I quit school and that's what I did

We gotta make a decision
Leave tonight or live and die this way
So I remember we were drivin', drivin' in your car

City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder
And I, I had a feeling that I belonged
And I, I had a feeling I could be someone
Be someone, be someone
You got a fast car
We go cruisin', entertain ourselves
Still ain't got a job
I work at the market as a checkout girl
I know things will get better
You'll find work and I'll get promoted
We'll move out of the shelter
Buy a bigger house and live in the suburbs

And I got a job that pays all our bills
You stay out drinkin' late at the bar
See more of your friends than you do of your kids
I'd always hoped for better
Thought maybe together you and me find it
I got no plans, I ain't goin' nowhere

Running through the garden trying to avoid the vipers

Left with nothing else but to keep wandering
Down this path whilst stopping my hands trembling

And graveyards open up their arms for mothers left to cry
I have seen the bleeding and I hate what we've done

So step on up to the plate get a date with Mraz
See you better act fast because supplies they never
Now did you know this is limited time offer
So go make your mind up before our times up
You better start winding it up because the party's almost over
(and if you should know girl, go a little bit lower now)
See how I would, if I could
I'd do most anything spontaneously
You know I would, and I can prove it
I'll do anything spontaneously

Counting every breath that you breathe

I hope I never learn an easy way to miss you

'Cause you're moving on and I'm not that strong to hold on any longer
As the sky outside gets brighter and my eyes begin to tire
I'm slowly drowning in memories of him
And I know it shouldn't matter as my heart begins to shatter
I'm left to wonder just how it should have been, yeah
12:51 and I thought my feelings were gone
But I'm lying on my bed, I'm not thinking of you again
And the moon shines so bright, but I gotta dry these tears tonight
'Cause you're moving on and I'm not that strong to hold on
'Cause I'll prove you wrong that I can move on through this song
So much stronger

干からびるまで歩いたら 今日は初っ端から日本酒だ
無論 縮み上がるほど
とびきり冷たいやつ
黙り込んでこそ響く歌
そんなのあるわけないけどあるかもよ

しゃがみこんでこそ届く夢

Prophets on the sidewalk begging for change
Old ladies laughing from the fire escape
Cursing my name
I got a basket full of lemons and they all taste the same
A window and a pigeon with a broken wing
You could spend your whole life working for something
Just to have it taken away
People walk around pushing back their debts
Wearing paychecks like necklaces and bracelets
Talking about nothing, not thinking 'bout death
Every little heartbeat, every little breath
People walk a tight rope on a razor's edge
Carrying their hurt and hatred and weapons
It could be a bomb, or a bullet or a pen
Or thought, or a word or a sentence
There ain't no reason things are this way
It's how they always been and they intend to stay
I don't know why I say the things I say
But I say them anyway
But love will come, set me free
Love will come, set me free, I do believe
Love will come, set me free, I know it will
Love will come, set me free, yes
Prison walls still standing tall
Some things never change at all
Keep on building prisons, gonna fill them all
Keep on building bombs, gonna drop them all
Working your fingers bare to the bone
Breaking your back, make you sell your soul
Like a lung, it's filled with cold
Suffocating slow
The wind blows wild and I may move
The politicians lie and I am not fooled
You don't need no razor or a three piece suit
To argue the truth
They air on my skin in the world under my toes
Slavery stitched to the fabric of my clothes
Chaos and commotion wherever I go
Love I try to follow
Love will come, set me free
Love will come, set me free, I do believe
Love will come, set me free, I know it will
Love will come, set me free, yes

Loving can heal
Loving can mend your soul
And it's the only thing that I know (know)
I swear it will get easier
Remember that with every peace of ya
And it's the only thing we take with us when we die

We made these memories for ourselves

And time's forever frozen still
So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me closer 'til our eyes meet

Well that's okay baby, only words bleed
Inside these pages you just hold me
And I won't ever let you go
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
You can fit me
Inside the necklace you bought
When you were sixteen
Next to your heartbeat where I should be
Keep it deep within your soul
And if you hurt me
Well that's okay baby, only words bleed
Inside these pages you just hold me (hold me)
And I won't ever let you go
When I'm away
I will remember how you kissed me
Under the lamppost back on Sixth street
Hearing you whisper through the phone
Wait for me to come home

And bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer
But my breath fogged up the glass
And so I drew a new face and I laughed

To rid yourself of vanities and just go with the seasons
It's what we aim to do
Our name is our virtue

Well, open up your mind and see like me (I won't hesitate)
Open up your plans and, damn, you're free (no more, no more)

Living is tricky as it is so that ain't stoppin' me
You and me, we both agree
That no one needs the scrutiny
All we want is peace and love, and honestly you ruined me
With your beautiful smile, and your style continuity
I'd be a fool not to take the opportunity to say
""Hey, we should be homies
I think we could be bigger than cheese and macaroni
We could keep it sweet like Chachi and Joanie
Or maybe just be ourselves, never phony""
Never second guessing the friendship connection
Parallel living, never in possession of your individual personal expression
Together we're just a much better reflection of
Love

Let it burn you to sleep

Or going back upon your promise after fighting for the right
Because your eggshells and your right statements
And your weaponized words, are paper tigers now

Are making it more and more alone

And so you're finishing up your coffee, but then where you're gonna run?
Where'd you get that look on your face?
You should always let the sun go down on your anger
Let it burn you to sleep
Bring it closer to danger, to surrender and retreat
Sing your sad soul to sleep
I loved you the first time I saw you
And you know I love you still
But I am tired
And I am yours
Don't even think about your freedom or taking that flight
Or going back upon your promise after fighting for the right
Because your eggshells and your right statements
And your weaponized words, are paper tigers now
Oh, your constant overthinking and your secretive drinking
Are making it more and more alone
And girl, I could slam the door behind you, it ain't never gonna close
Because when you're home, you're already home
I am tired
I am tired
I don't wanna go home anymore
I don't wanna throw stones anymore
I don't wanna take part in the war
I loved you the first time I saw you
And you know I love you still
I loved you the first time I saw you
And you know I love you still
I don't wanna be right anymore
Lord, I don't wanna fight anymore
I'm not taking your side anymore
I am tired
I am not my own
And I am leaving
Oh, I am tired
But I'm coming home
'Cause I am yours, I am yours, I am yours
I am yours, I am yours
I am yours, I am yours, I am yours
I am yours, I am yours

Without you
I've got no place, no place to go.
It'll be lonely this Christmas
Without you to hold
It'll be lonely this Christmas
Lonely and cold
It'll be cold, so cold
Without you to hold
This Christmas.
Each time I remember
The day you went away
And how I would listen
To things you have to say
I just break down
As I look around
And the only things I see
Are emptiness and loneliness
And an unlit Christmas tree.
It'll be lonely this Christmas
Without you to hold
It'll be lonely this Christmas
Lonely and cold
It'll be cold, so cold
Without you to hold
This Christmas.
You remember last year?
When you and I were here
We never thought there'd be an end.
And I remember looking at you then thinking
That Christmas must have been made for you and for me
Cause darlin'
This is the time that you really need love
When it means so very very much.
It'll be lonely this Christmas
Without you to hold
It'll be lonely this Christmas
Lonely and cold
It'll be cold, so cold
Without you to hold

But we don't keep in touch the way we used to nowadays
Your eyes are not as bright as I remember them to be
The light inside's grown dim and that's hard for me to see
The creases on your forehead run like treads on a tire
The white stripe running through your bangs a long, twisted spire
You're sweeping up the flies and you've been vacuuming the fires
And you lay down every night next to a goddamn liar
You may be here today, but tomorrow you're a ghost
I guess the most someone can hope for is to find a place to lay
Someone to tell your secrets to when the nights get long and blue
Someone strong enough to lean on when the roses fall away
Strong enough to love you when you're wrong
Someone strong enough to love you when you're wrong
When the day is winding down my heart abandons me for you
You forgot yourself so long ago and I wish I could too
But you live inside a quiet hell, no one can pray away
Leaving would be easy, I understand why you won't stay
You may be here today, but tomorrow you're a ghost
I guess the most someone can hope for is to find a place to lay
Someone to tell your secrets to when the nights get long and blue
Someone strong enough to lean on when the roses fall away
Strong enough to love you when you're wrong
Someone strong enough to love you when you're, when you're wrong, mm
You'll be wrong if you were thinking that we all don't fade away
Like dew drops in the dawn, like sunbeams through the haze
It's a long way to be sinking, holding tightly to the weights
Of the one who pulls you down while you slowly waste your days
Someone strong enough to love you when you're wrong
Someone strong enough to love you when you're wrong
When you're wrong
Ooh, when you're wrong

In the summertime when the water's gone
Diagonal lines in their rolled-out lawns
And the sage always smells so pretty
But nobody cares where the birds have gone
When the rain comes down on Babylon
The stonemason's phone rings all day long
And you gotta get back to the city
I build my house up on this rock, baby
Every day with you
There's nothin' in that town I need
After everything we've been through
Me out in my garden and you out on your walk
Is all the distance this poor girl can take
Without listenin' to you talk
I don't need their money, baby
Just you and me on the rock
It's you and me on the rock
I built paper planes when I learned to fly
Like a 747 fallin' out of the sky
I folded 'em crooked and now I'm wonderin' why
I could always end up in the water
But nobody's askin' why she lookin' so thin
Why she's laughin' too hard, why she drinkin' again
A falling star, she's a paper plane
And she was goin' down when you caught her
I build my house up on this rock, baby
Every day with you
There's nothin' in that town I need
After everything we've been through
Me out in my garden and you out on your walk
Is all the distance this poor girl can take
Without listenin' to you talk
I don't need their money, baby
Just you and me on the rock
It's an earthquake, it's a hard wind
It's a record-breakin' tide and it is rollin' in
It's a big sea, but it can't touch you and me
It's just a water view
And what a view
I don't need their money, baby
I don't need their money, baby
It's you and me on the rock
You and me on the rock
It's you and me on the rock
I build my house up on this rock, baby
Every day with you
There's nothin' in that town I need
After everything we've been through
Me out in my garden and you out on your walk
Is all the distance this old girl can take
Without listenin' to you talk
I don't need their money, baby
Just you and me on the rock, mm
It's you and me on the rock
You and me on the rock
I don't need their money, baby
I don't need their money, baby
It's you and me on the rock
It's you and me
You and me on the rock
Hey, it's you and me
It's you and me
You and me on the rock

とうに忘れてしまったよ
夕暮れで 二人 少しずつ見えなくなっていって
それなのに 僕ら 帰れずにいた
どこかに 壊れそうな脆い心
強がる言葉で覆って隠してる
覆って隠してる
サヨナラ 会えなくなったって
僕らは続きがあるから
君のいない世界だって走るよ
いつかの痛みも越えて
越えて
割れたガラスのかけら 草むらの匂い 夏の傷口
ねぇ 君は今 どこにいるの
澄み切った水も いつしか鈍く濁ってしまって
気づいたら 僕も 大人になってた
ゆらゆら 水面 乱反射していた
光は今でも輝き渡ってる
輝き渡ってる
サヨナラ あの日 手を振って
あれから君も変わったんだろう
それでも生きていくんだって
いくつも泣きたい夜を越えて
あの日 ホントに失ったものって何だったっけ
サヨナラ 会えなくなったって 僕らは続きがあるから
僕が創る世界なんで走るよ
いつか見た未来も越えて
越えて
